<h1>What is Biodiversity and Why Does it <br>Matter to US?</h1>
</div>

<div class="divider"></div>

<div class="text-container">

<p>The air you breathe, the water you drink and the food you eat all rely on biodiversity, but
right now it is in crisis – because of us. What does this mean for our future and can we
	stop it?</p>

<p>by Damian Carrington Environment editor.</p>

<h2>What is biodiversity?</h2>

<p>It is the variety of life on Earth, in all its forms and all its interactions. If that sounds
bewilderingly broad, that’s because it is. Biodiversity is the most complex feature of our
	planet and it is the most vital.</p>

<p>The term was coined in 1985 – a contraction of “biological diversity” – but the huge
global biodiversity losses now becoming apparent represent a crisis equaling – or quite
possibly surpassing – climate change.</p>

<p>More formally, biodiversity is comprised of several levels, starting with genes, then
individual species, then communities of creatures and finally entire ecosystems, such as
forests or coral reefs, where life interplays with the physical environment. These myriad
	interactions have made Earth habitable for billions of years.</p>

<p>A more philosophical way of viewing biodiversity is this: it represents the knowledge
learned by evolving species over millions of years about how to survive through the
vastly varying environmental conditions Earth has experienced. Seen like that, experts
	warn, humanity is currently “burning the library of life”.</p>

<p>Do animals and bugs really matter to me?</p>

<p>For many people living in towns and cities, wildlife is often something you watch on
television. But the reality is that the air you breathe, the water you drink and the food
you eat all ultimately rely on biodiversity. Some examples are obvious: without plants
	there would be no oxygen and without bees to pollinate there would be no fruit or nuts.</p>

<p>Others are less obvious – coral reefs and mangrove swamps provide invaluable
protection from cyclones and tsunamis for those living on coasts, while trees can absorb
air pollution in urban areas.</p>

<p>Others appear bizarre – tropical tortoises and spider monkeys seemingly have little to
do with maintaining a stable climate. But the dense, hardwood trees that are most effective in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere rely on their seeds being
    dispersed by these large fruit-eaters.</p>

    <p>When scientists explore each ecosystem, they find countless such interactions, all honed
    by millions of years of evolution. If undamaged, this produces a finely balanced, healthy
    system which contributes to a healthy sustainable planet.</p>

    <p>The sheer richness of biodiversity also has human benefits. Many new medicines are
    harvested from nature, such as a fungus that grows on the fur of sloths and can fight
    cancer. Wild varieties of domesticated animals and crops are also crucial as some will
    have already solved the challenge of, for example, coping with drought or salty soils.</p>

    <p>If money is a measure, the services provided by ecosystems are estimated to be worth
    trillions of dollars – double the world’s GDP. Biodiversity loss in Europe alone costs the
    continent about 3% of its GDP, or €450m (£400m), a year.</p>

    <p>From an aesthetic point of view, every one of the millions of species is unique, a natural
    work of art that cannot be recreated once lost. “Each higher organism is richer in
    information than a Caravaggio painting, a Bach fugue, or any other great work,” wrote
    Prof Edward O Wilson, often called the “father of biodiversity”, in a seminal paper in
        1985.</p>

    <p>Just how diverse is biodiversity?</p>

    <p>Mind-bogglingly diverse. The simplest aspect to consider is species. About 1.7 million
    species of animals, plants and fungi have been recorded, but there are likely to be 8-9
    million and possibly up to 100 million. The heartland of biodiversity is the tropics,
    which teems with species. In 15 hectares (37 acres) of Borneo forest, for example, there
    are 700 species of tree – the same number as the whole of
        North America.</p>

    <p>Recent work considering diversity at a genetic level has suggested that creatures thought
    to be a single species could in some cases actually be dozens. Then add in bacteria and
    viruses, and the number of distinct organisms may well be in the billions. A single
    spoonful of soil – which ultimately provides 90% of all food – contains 10,000 to
        50,000 different types of bacteria.</p>

    <p>The concern is that many species are being lost before we are even aware of them, or the
    role they play in the circle of life.</p>

    <p>How bad is it?</p>

    <p>Very. The best studied creatures are the ones like us – large mammals. Tiger numbers,
    for example, have plunged by 97% in the last century. In many places, bigger animals
        have already been wiped out by humans – think dodos or woolly mammoths.</p>
